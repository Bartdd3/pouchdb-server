This is the monorepo for PouchDB-Server and Express-PouchDB. It follows the same format as the (PouchDB monorepo](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb). This follows the [alle](https://github.com/boennemann/alle) monorepo setup. You can read more about monorepo's [here](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)) and (here)[https://gist.github.com/nolanlawson/457cdb309c9ec5b39f0d420266a9faa4].

If you think you've found a bug in PouchDB, please write a reproducible test case and file [a Github issue](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues). We recommend [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) for code snippets, because some iframe-based services like JSFiddle and JSBin do not support IndexedDB in all browsers. You can start with [this template](https://gist.github.com/nolanlawson/816f138a51b86785d3e6).
